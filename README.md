🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes the biomolecule sensing performance of Double-Gate Junctionless FETs (DGJLFETs) using dielectric modulation, focusing on the impact of channel length variation and biomolecule permittivity.

🔹 What Was Done

Simulated DGJLFET devices with channel lengths from 40 nm to 100 nm.

Evaluated sensing performance for different biomolecules (varying dielectric constants).

Analyzed electrical characteristics such as Id–Vgs, threshold voltage shift, and sensitivity.

Identified long-channel devices as more stable due to reduced short-channel effects.

🔹 Technology & Tools

Silvaco ATLAS (TCAD)

DGJLFET device modeling

Dielectric modulation technique

🔹 How to Reproduce

Open Silvaco ATLAS.

Load device structure and material definitions.

🔹 Results Summary

Long-channel DGJLFETs showed improved stability and reduced ambiguity.

Sensitivity increased with higher biomolecule dielectric constant.

🔹 Key Learning

Developed strong understanding of device-level modeling, short-channel effects, and TCAD-based biosensor evaluation.
